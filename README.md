# Screeps
My screeps code

NOTE: I am a complete noob, both in screeps as well as programming/JavaScript.
I do everything by trail and error and there are probably many ways my code can be improved.

Here's some things that I learned along the way:

- Do not worry if all your creeps die, even if you only find out after a few days. You'll probably be fine, most players don't even have attack code (I think ;))
- console.log('why is this not working?'); is your friend
- With prototypes you can add functions and variables to existing objects.
    I used this to add functions to creeps, rooms and spawns
- I suck at math
- I've added autocomplete files that I found on here. Im not really sure how that works exactly but it's amazing
    I think it created an index.d.ts file on my laptop where I can add descriptions to the functions I added with the prototype method.
    Or maybe this index file already existed? No idea. Pretty handy though!
